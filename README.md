# Week1-assignment

# This project was heavily inspired on the space website example we were given.

# It provided a good challenge to replicate it as best as i could as well as making it my own.

# In future, i will be updating this repo and building on this website and adding key features, as well as all of the stretch challenges. the initial submission for the weekly submission is just to cover requirements and an additional stretch challenge.

# As for external help for building it, i used mdn to help in w3schools to help make the nav bar align with the main title as i struggled in making that happen. i also used mdn to help figure out how to make the background an image and seperating them into 3 sections.

# I used a lot of previous workshops to help with everything such as positioning.

# I achieved all requirements and half of the footer stretch as well as the hover effect stretch challenge.
